Gateway aims to create a harmonious ecosystem where web2 applications and components can coexist with decentralized web3 technologies, fostering a more robust and inclusive development community.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"motivation/archway":{"id":"motivation/archway","title":"Archway","description":"Rewards play a crucial and distinctive role within the Archway ecosystem, particularly for dApp developers. By incentivizing positive actions on web3, Archway can fuel a virtuous cycle: greater rewards lead to increased developer participation, the creation of high-quality dApps, a higher volume of web3 actions (transactions), and even more rewards. This process not only promotes financial decentralization but also ensures equal opportunities for developers worldwide.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"motivation/gateway":{"id":"motivation/gateway","title":"Gateway","description":"To bridge this gap, we introduce Gateway\u2014a service on Archway that rewards web2 actions. Picture a scenario where each node runs the same deterministic JavaScript code, triggered by a transaction, with the results uploaded simultaneously to the blockchain and validated by a smart contract. In this context, the web2 logic represented by JavaScript code is executed and validated without undermining the principles of web3 decentralization.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"roadmap":{"id":"roadmap","title":"Roadmap","description":"The Gateway project\'s progression is marked by several milestones to ensure its smooth and successful implementation.
