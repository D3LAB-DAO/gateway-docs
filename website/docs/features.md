- **Archway-compatible rewards for web2 apps and developers**: By utilizing Gateway, web2 apps and developers can be rewarded based on the volume of triggering transactions in an Archway-compatible manner. Gateway allows Archway to reward both web2 and web3 app developers, fostering a more inclusive ecosystem and accelerating the positive feedback loop.
- **Decentralized execution and validation**: Gateway enables the execution and validation of deterministic JavaScript codes (or codes written in any language) triggered by on-chain transactions without compromising web3 decentralization principles. This ensures that web2 logic represented by JavaScript codes can be executed and validated in a decentralized manner.
- **Integration of web2 applications and components**: Gateway allows web2 applications and components, such as AI, databases, and games, to be integrated into Archway, with their usage being rewarded by the platform.
- **ARCH as a universal asset**: With Gateway, ARCH becomes a universal common asset for all web2, web3, and hybrid applications, further solidifying its position within the broader digital landscape.
