# Roadmap

The Gateway project's progression is marked by several milestones to ensure its smooth and successful implementation. The roadmap is comprised of the following phases:

1. **Research and Development:** During this phase, the team will concentrate on researching optimal methods for enabling deterministic code execution and validation through on-chain transactions. Additionally, they will identify potential challenges and solutions for integrating web2 applications and components into the Archway platform.
2. **Proof of Concept:** The team will create a proof of concept to demonstrate the Gateway project's feasibility, showcasing deterministic code execution and validation, as well as the integration and rewarding of web2 applications within the Archway ecosystem.
3. **Beta Release:** Following the successful testing of the proof of concept, the team will release a beta version of the Gateway project, inviting select developers to build, test, and provide feedback on the platform.
4. **Launch:** Once the beta testing phase is complete and necessary improvements have been incorporated, the Gateway project will launch on the Archway mainnet, making the platform accessible to developers worldwide.
5. **Continuous Improvement and Expansion:** The team will continuously work to improve and expand the Gateway project, integrating new features, optimizing the platform, and fostering partnerships to enhance the ecosystem.
