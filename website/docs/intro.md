# Introduction

Gateway is revolutionizing the digital service landscape by bridging the gap between web2 and web3, enabling a more open and collaborative internet.
This fusion empowers developers to craft invaluable applications that blend features from both worlds.

Particularly, Gateway leverages Archway's reward ecosystem to offer direct incentives for web2 activities, enticing developers to embrace the combined potential of web2 and web3 technologies.
Through the introduction of a system that integrates and validates deterministic code execution, Gateway can efficiently distribute rewards to web2 applications and developers in proportion to the volume of triggering transactions.
