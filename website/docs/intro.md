# Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive guide to Project Gateway, a groundbreaking solution developed to seamlessly connect Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies using the Archway platform. Gateway aims to create a harmonious ecosystem where web2 applications and components can coexist with decentralized web3 technologies, fostering a more robust and inclusive development community.

The primary purpose of Gateway is to enable Archway to reward web2 actions, allowing developers to benefit from both web2 and web3 technologies. By introducing a system that integrates and validates deterministic code execution, Gateway can efficiently reward web2 apps and developers based on the volume of triggering transactions. This innovative approach promotes the growth and development of decentralized applications, driving the adoption of Archway and decentralized technologies worldwide.
